To determine if an object is a raw object, retrieve the value of the `data_store` parameter from the [Retrieve Object Metadata](https://developer.veevavault.com/api/25.1/#Retrieve_Object_Metadata) endpoint. Learn more about [raw objects in Vault Help](https://platform.veevavault.help/en/lr/62987/).\n\nAfter initiating an asynchronous request, your raw object’s `configuration_state` becomes `IN_DEPLOYMENT`. While a raw object is `IN_DEPLOYMENT`, you cannot edit its fields, list layouts, or indexes. If your raw object deployment request has not yet begun execution, you can [cancel](https://developer.veevavault.com/api/25.1/#Cancel_HVO) the deployment.\n\nIf you don't need to use the [asynchronous request](https://developer.veevavault.com/api/25.1/#Execute_MDL_Async), it is best practice to use the [synchronous request](https://developer.veevavault.com/api/25.1/#Execute_MDL)."

					"description": "Duplicate records in Vault can happen due to migrations, integrations, or day-to-day activities and may be difficult to resolve. Vault provides a solution to duplicate records by allowing you to merge two records together. You can only initiate record merges through the Vault API or the [Vault Java SDK](https://developer.veevavault.com/sdk/#Record_Merges), and you cannot initiate a record merge through the Vault UI.\n\nYour organization may want to create custom [Record Merge Event Handlers](https://developer.veevavault.com/sdk/#Record_Merge_Event_Handlers) with the Vault Java SDK, which can execute custom logic immediately when a record merge begins or after a record merge completes. For example, directly after a merge starts, you can retrieve the field values on the duplicate record. Directly after the merge completes, you can update any desired information from the duplicate record to the main record. This overrides the default merge behavior which does not copy data between the duplicate and main record.\n\nLearn more about [merging records in Vault Help](https://platform.veevavault.help/en/lr/659058)."

For example, you can use this endpoint to provide verdicts for specific items without completing the task. This endpoint does not support initiating task actions requiring eSignatures (where `esignature` is `true`).\n\n#### **Body Parameters**\n\nControls with `required=true` in the [Retrieve Workflow Task Action Details](https://developer.veevavault.com/api/23.3/#Retrieve_Workflow_Task_Action_Details) response can be provided. If a control (such as `verdict`) defines a set of required fields, those can also be provided. For example, a specific verdict may prompt for comments, reasons, or capacities.\n\nIn the body of the request, upload parameters as a JSON file. This request may require the following body parameters:\n\n| **Name** | **Description** |\n| --- | --- |\n| `verdict_public_key__c`  <br>**conditional** | The verdict name. Retrieve possible verdict `name` values by sending a request to [Retrieve Workflow Task Action Details](https://developer.veevavault.com/api/23.3/#Retrieve_Workflow_Task_Action_Details). |\n| `reason__c`  <br>**conditional** | The reason name. Retrieve possible reason `name` values by sending a request to [Retrieve Workflow Task Action Details](https://developer.veevavault.com/api/23.3/#Retrieve_Workflow_Task_Action_Details). |\n| `capacity__c`  <br>**conditional** | The capacity name. Retrieve possible capacity `name` values by sending a request to [Retrieve Workflow Task Action Details](https://developer.veevavault.com/api/23.3/#Retrieve_Workflow_Task_Action_Details). |\n\n#### **Example JSON Request Body: Multiple Verdicts**\n\n``` json\n{\n   \"contents__sys\": [\n{\n         \"object__v\": \"batch__v\",\n         \"record_id__v\": \"0BA000000000101\",\n       \"verdict_public_key__c\": \"verdict_not_approved__c\",\n       \"verdict_not_approved_comment__c\": \"Needs to be redone.\"\n     },\n     {\n         \"object__v\": \"batch__v\",\n         \"record_id__v\": \"0BA000000002001\",\n       \"verdict_public_key__c\": \"verdict_approved__c\"\n     },\n    {\n         \"object__v\": \"batch__v\",\n         \"record_id__v\": \"0BA000000002002\",\n       \"verdict_public_key__c\": \"verdict_not_approved__c\",\n       \"verdict_not_approved_comment__c\": \"Does not meet standards.\"\n     }\n   ]\n}\n\n ```\n\n#### **Example Response**\n\n``` json\n{\n    \"responseStatus\": \"SUCCESS\"\n}\n\n ```\n\n#### Response Details\n\nOn `SUCCESS`, Vault modifies the contents in the multi-item workflow according to the JSON payload provided. Use [Retrieve Workflow Task Action Details](https://developer.veevavault.com/api/23.3/#Retrieve_Workflow_Task_Action_Details) to confirm any changes to `current_values`. You must use [Complete Multi-item Workflow Task](https://developer.veevavault.com/api/25.1/#Complete_Multi-item_Workflow_Task) to complete the open workflow task."

The different types of steps offer a flexible way to organize a wide variety of processes for an object record, including assigning tasks to users, sending notifications, updating fields, and changing a record's lifecycle state or sharing settings. Workflow tasks can allow users to enter comments, choose verdicts (approve, deny, etc.), populate fields, or provide eSignatures.\n\nObject workflows are specific to a single lifecycle, meaning that one (1) workflow cannot apply to multiple object lifecycles. A single object record can only be in one (1) workflow at a time. Learn more about [Object Workflows in Vault Help](https://platform.veevavault.help/en/lr/33498/)."

A lifecycle can be simple (two states requiring users to manually move between states) or very complex (multiple states with different security and workflows that automatically move the document to another state). In Vault, lifecycles simplify the implementation of business logic that traditionally required custom coding or time-consuming manual setup.\n\nLifecycle states are the ordered states within a lifecycle representing the stages a document transitions through as users create, review, approve, and eventually archive or replace it. A set of business rules applies to each state and defines what happens to the document in that state. Admins define these rules for each lifecycle state and Vault automatically applies them to every document that enters the state.\n\nLearn about <a href=\"https://platform.veevavault.help/en/lr/52053\">Lifecycles & Workflows in Vault Help</a>.\n\n"

A lifecycle can be simple (two states that require users to manually move between them) or very complex (multiple states with different security and workflows that automatically move records from one state to another). In Vault, lifecycles simplify the implementation of business logic that traditionally required custom coding or time-consuming manual setup. A set of business rules applies to each state and defines what happens to object records in that state. Admins define these rules for each lifecycle state and Vault automatically applies them to every object record that enters the state.\n\nLearn about <a href=\"https://platform.veevavault.help/en/lr/52053\">Lifecycles & Workflows</a> in Vault Help.\n\n"

This information is similar to the information displayed in the Vault UI from **Admin > Settings > General Settings**.\n\nSome Vaults use multiple applications, for example, a RIM Vault with Submissions and Registrations. In these Vaults, users have a license value for each application they can access. Application licensing allows Vault to track available licenses at the application level, but does not control a user’s access in most Vaults. A user assigned to multiple applications will use one (1) application license per application.

The log contains information such as user name, user ID, remaining burst limit, and the endpoint called.

If your log does not include appropriate data, know that your data is not lost; it is just not yet populated.\n\nThe logs are designed for troubleshooting burst limits and discovering which of your integrations are causing you to hit the limit. These logs should not be used for auditing, as they are not designed with the appropriate level of restrictions. For example, if an API request fails to enter the usage log, the API call is not prevented from executing, which would be required if this log was designed for auditing.

The HTTP Response Header `Content-Type` is set to `application/octet-stream`. The returned CSV or Logfile includes the following data:\n\n| Name | Description |\n| --- | --- |\n| `timestamp` | The date and time of this API request, in UTC. |\n| `session_id` | The Session ID of the user who made the request. |\n| `user_id` | The ID of the user who made the request. |\n| `username` | The Vault user name (login credentials) of the user who made the request. |\n| `http_method` | The HTTP Method of the request, for example, `POST`. |\n| `endpoint` | The Vault API endpoint used for this request. |\n| `http_response_status` | The HTTP response status of the request, for example, 200. |\n| `api_version` | The Vault API version used for this request, for example, v18.1. This value is blank for endpoints which do not have an API version. |\n| `api_response_status` | The API response status, for example, `SUCCESS`. This column may be blank for requests where the response contains binary content, such as files. |\n| `api_response_error_type` | The API response error type, for example, `INSUFFICIENT_ACCESS`. |\n| `execution_id` | Unique ID generated by Vault for each API request. Returned in the response header `X-VaultAPI-ExecutionId`. |\n| `client_id` | The client ID passed with this request. If the API request did not include a client ID, this value is `unknown`. If the API received a `client_id` which was incorrectly formatted, this value is `invalid_client_id`. Learn more about [Client ID in the Vault API Documentation](https://developer.veevavault.com/docs/#Client_ID). |\n| `client_ip` | The IP address of the client, which is where the call originated. |\n| `burst_limit_remaining` | The number of API calls remaining in your burst limit. Learn more about [API Limits](https://developer.veevavault.com/docs/#api_rate_limits). |\n| `duration` | The time it takes an API request to execute in Vault, measured in milliseconds. Note the duration does not include transport times between Vault and the client. |\n| `response_delay` | This column is populated whenever API calls are throttled and indicates the length of the delay in milliseconds. |\n| `sdk_count` | This column is populated if the API request invoked custom Vault Java SDK code, and indicates the total number of SDK entry points executed in this request. Learn more about [Vault Java SDK performance metrics](https://developer.veevavault.com/docs/#SDK_Performance_API_Headers). |\n| `sdk_cpu_time` | This column is populated if the API request invoked custom Vault Java SDK code, and indicates the total CPU processing time required for this request in nanoseconds. Learn more about [Vault Java SDK performance metrics](https://developer.veevavault.com/docs/#SDK_Performance_API_Headers). |\n| `sdk_elasped_time` | This column is populated if the API request invoked custom Vault Java SDK code, and indicates the total elapsed time for this request in milliseconds. Learn more about [Vault Java SDK performance metrics](https://developer.veevavault.com/docs/#SDK_Performance_API_Headers). |\n| `sdk_gross_memory` | This column is populated if the API request invoked custom Vault Java SDK code, and indicates the total gross memory required for this request in bytes. Learn more about [Vault Java SDK performance metrics](https://developer.veevavault.com/docs/#SDK_Performance_API_Headers). |\n| `connection` | The `api_name__sys` of the matching _Connection_ record associated with this request. If this is a trusted Veeva connection, such as Vault Loader, Vault Mobile, or Station Manager, this value is `vault__sys`. If there is no associated connection, this value is blank. |\n| `api_resource` | The API resource for the request. For example, the primary query object for a VQL request. |\n| `api_response_warning_type` | The API request warning type. For example, `DUPLICATE`. |\n| `api_response_warning_message` | The API request warning message. For example, “Duplicate query execution detected. Consider caching commonly required data.” |\n| `api_response_error_message` | The API request error message. For example, “product__b is not a queryable object; please refer to api documentation”. |\n| `reference_id` | The `X-VaultAPI-ReferenceId`header value.

File parts can be from 5-50MB by default, although limits for your Vault may vary.\n3. **Commit Upload Session**: After you upload all file parts, use this endpoint to end the session and make the completed, reassembled file available in the file staging server.\n\nUse the additional helper endpoints in this section to manage upload sessions. Each Vault allows up to 50 active upload sessions at a time. By default, upload sessions remain active for 72 hours after creation. If a session expires before it is committed, Vault will auto-purge all parts of the upload."
