# Veeva Vault OpenAPI Client SDK Generator

This project takes the Veeva Vault OpenAPI specification (`spec/openapi.yaml`) and automatically generates client SDKs for **all languages supported by the OpenAPI Generator** using GitHub Actions workflows.

## How it works

Whenever the OpenAPI spec is updated, GitHub Actions will:

1. Validate the OpenAPI spec.
2. Generate client SDK code for every supported language listed below.
3. Push the generated code for each language to its own dedicated branch named `generated-<language>-client`.

This means that updating the OpenAPI spec will automatically update all SDKs for every language, with each language's code isolated in its own branch for easy access and integration.

## Branch workflow

- Each language's generated SDK is pushed to its own branch: `generated-<language>-client`.
- Any update to the OpenAPI spec will automatically regenerate and update all SDK branches.

This makes it easy to keep all client SDKs up to date and accessible for any language supported by the OpenAPI Generator.

### `generate-clients.yml`

* **Trigger:** After a successful `validate-openapi.yml` run or manual
  invocation.
* **Purpose:** Uses `openapitools/openapi-generator` to generate API clients for
  several languages (Java, JavaScript, Python, Ruby, R, Rust, Go, C# and C). The
  resulting client code for each language is pushed to a dedicated branch named
  `generated-<language>-client`. You can adjust the language matrix to suit your
  needs.

### `build-docs.yml`

* **Trigger:** After a successful `validate-openapi.yml` run or manual
  invocation.
* **Purpose:** Bundles static HTML documentation using ReDoc and pushes the
  result to the `generated-docs` branch. The workflow also uploads the site as a
  Pages artifact and deploys it using `actions/deploy-pages` so the API docs are
  published with GitHub Pages.

### `deploy-api-docs.yml`

* **Trigger:** Pushes to `main`, after validation succeeds, or manual invocation.
* **Purpose:** Generates ReDoc HTML and deploys it to GitHub Pages, similar to
  `build-docs.yml`, but includes additional setup for the Pages environment and
  concurrency controls. The generated documentation is also kept on the
  `generated-docs` branch. Use this workflow if you want an all-in-one build and
  deploy job on the `main` branch.

## Branch workflow

1. Work on your OpenAPI specification in a feature branch or the `staging`
   branch. When pushing to `staging`, the autoâ€‘fix workflow may commit missing
   titles back for you.
2. Create a pull request targeting `main`. Once merged, the
   `validate-openapi.yml` workflow verifies the spec.
3. After successful validation the documentation and client generation workflows
   run automatically and publish their results.
